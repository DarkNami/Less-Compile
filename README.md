# Less Compile

Less compile uses the official node.js version of Less 1.7.0 for auto-compiling .less files on save.

The less file is compiled into a compressed .css version in the same directory as the .less file. E.g. styles.less -> styles.css

The auto-compile is only triggered on files with the .less extension.

# Commands
less:compile - This is the same as simply saving the file.

# Keyboard Shortcut
ctrl + alt + L
